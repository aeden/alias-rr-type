This repository holds the files used to generate the Internet Draft describing the ALIAS (aka ANAME or CNAME-flattening) record type.

## Building

You will need to install the following tools on your system to build the Internet Draft:

- pandoc
- xsltproc (via libxml2)
- xml2rfc

The templates used within this repo are originally from the https://github.com/miekg/pandoc2rfc/ repo.
